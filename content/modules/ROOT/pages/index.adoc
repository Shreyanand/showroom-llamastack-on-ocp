= LlamaStack on OpenShift

== Welcome to the LlamaStack on OpenShift Workshop

This lab aims to provide a comprehensive, hands-on experience in developing intelligent AI agents with OpenShift, Llama Stack and MCP (Model Context Protocol). Through a progressive series of Jupyter notebooks, participants will learn to build agents capable of utilizing both internal knowledge bases and external web resources, as well as interacting directly with a live OpenShift environment.

== Lab Objectives

Master the basics of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using LlamaStack for information retrieval from custom data sources.
Develop agents with the capability to utilize external tools like web search to gather a wider range of information.
Explore advanced agentic capabilities, including location awareness, prompt chaining, and the ReAct framework for complex reasoning and decision-making.
Integrate RAG, prompt chaining, and MCP tools to build sophisticated automated systems, such as incident response systems within OpenShift.
Gain practical experience in interacting with and managing OpenShift environments through intelligent agents, automating operational tasks.
Learn how to leverage agents for effective communication and task automation within platforms like Slack, using MCP tools.

== Lab Structure

The lab is structured as a series of Jupyter notebooks that progressively increase in complexity:

Level 0: Environment setup and necessary Python package installations.
Level 1 - Simple RAG: Introduction to basic RAG principles for information retrieval from internal documents.
Level 2  - Simple Agent with Web Search: Building agents that can use external web search for information gathering.
Level 3 - Advanced Agents with Prompt Chaining ReAct: Implementing location awareness, prompt chaining, and the ReAct framework for more complex decision-making processes.
Level 4 - RAG Agent: Strategically integrating RAG as a tool within the agent's decision-making process.
Level 5 - Agents and MCP: Utilizing MCP tools to interact with OpenShift and Slack for operational automation and communication.
Level 6 - Agents, MCP and RAG: Combining prompt chaining, RAG, and MCP tools to develop a complete, automated incident response system.

This lab will empower participants to construct and deploy AI agents capable of navigating intricate tasks, retrieving relevant information from multiple sources, and automating operational workflows within an enterprise-grade OpenShift environment.
