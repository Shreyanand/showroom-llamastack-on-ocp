= Level 1 - Simple RAG

This level introduces the fundamental principles of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using LlamaStack for information retrieval from custom knowledge sources.

== Focus

This notebook introduces the fundamental principles of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). It clearly demonstrates how to leverage the LlamaStack framework to access and retrieve information from internal knowledge repositories. The primary goal is to show how the system can answer user questions by intelligently searching and extracting relevant details from existing documents. This forms the bedrock for more advanced agent capabilities.

== Learning Objective

Understand the core mechanics of RAG using LlamaStack for information retrieval from custom sources.

== Task Example

A user asks, "Explain the step-by-step process for installing OpenShift, referencing the official installation guide PDF."

== Expected Agent Behavior

The agent will utilize the RAG component to search our internal document store, locate the OpenShift installation guide, extract the relevant sections detailing the installation process, and then present a summarized explanation back to the user, citing the guide as its source.

== Key Concepts Demonstrated

* *Knowledge Base Interaction:* Connecting to and querying internal documents.
* *Retrieval Mechanism:* How LlamaStack identifies and extracts relevant information.
* *Basic Question Answering:* Using retrieved content to directly answer user queries.
* *Contextual Awareness (Limited):* Focusing solely on information within the provided documents.
